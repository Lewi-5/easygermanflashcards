This is a vocabulary flash card full-stack project made for FSD-08 class 'Integration into the Labor Market'
A full stack application consisting of a react front end, a node js backend, a MongoDB database, and hosted on Hostinger.
I took this project as an opportunity to learn and develop my typescript skills, thus all javascript across the tech-stack 
was originally written in typescript
